<span style="color: black;">I am a full-time PhD Scholar (Biostatistics and Demography), at the [International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai](https://iipsindia.ac.in/). My research interest includes Probability Theory in Statistics, Modelling the transition between co-morbid diseases, Spatial Epidemiology and identifying the risk factors or determinants of Maternal & Child Health and Childhood Mortality.</span>

<span style="color: black;">I graduated from the [Dhanamanjuri Univerisity, Imphal](https://dmu.ac.in/) with Statistics (honours) in 2014. Later I completed the Post Graduate Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics from [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Tezpur](http://www.isine.ac.in/) (2014-15 batch). Then in 2015, I joined [IIPS, Mumbai](https://iipsindia.ac.in/) for MSc degree in Biostatistics and Demography (2015-17 batch). I continue for MPhil degree in the same institute (2018-19 batch). I was awarded the “Prof. Tara Kanitkar Gold Medal” for securing the first rank in MPhil. Before I join the MPhil program, I had also worked as a Research Assistant in [IIPS, Mumbai](https://iipsindia.ac.in/) under the project entitled “Goal Setting and Identification of Priority Interventions for Odisha using Lives Saved Tool (LiST): An Analysis Based on NFHS-4 Data”.</span>

<span style="color: black;">I would like to see myself as a data scientist analysing data to answer research questions on diverse real-world problems. Throughout my academic journey, I have stressed myself in developing excellent technical writing and analytical skills using various statistical software’s. I have also attended several conferences and workshops presenting papers on different research areas viz. undernutrition, diabetes, maternal and child health, etc. Thus, I have expertise myself in handling large-scale data with the help of statistical software viz. R, STATA, SPSS, Base SAS, Excel etc. This includes Data mining, data cleaning, ensuring data quality and creating reports with clear visualisation. Currently, I am investigating questions related to “U5 Mortality in India using Conventional as well as Bayesian statistical techniques” through my PhD Thesis in the Department of Public Health and Mortality Studies, [IIPS, Mumbai](https://iipsindia.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Abhishek Singh](https://iipsindia.ac.in/deparment-faculties/37).</span> 
        
<span style="color: black;">Also, I am an R enthusiast. And I love coding in R.</span>
